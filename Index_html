    <h2>Career Background</h2>
    <div class="cards">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Customer Service Experience at Clarks</h3>
        <p>
          Working at Clarks strengthened my communication skills and taught me the importance of customer care. I regularly assisted families and young children, ensuring they had a comfortable and positive shopping experience. Through measuring children’s feet, helping them choose the right sizes and styles, and addressing their needs calmly, I learned patience and professionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also handled payments, refunds, and store transactions, which built my confidence in money handling, accuracy, and responsibility. This experience helped shape my ability to solve problems quickly and deal with high‑pressure situations.

        <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          Outside academics, I enjoy staying active and keeping my mind refreshed through sports. As a proud Manchester United supporter, following matches and analysing team strategies has helped me understand teamwork, leadership, and performance improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love travelling and experiencing new cultures, as well as helping others — both of which inspire me to stay open‑minded and empathetic, qualities that are essential in modern project management.
