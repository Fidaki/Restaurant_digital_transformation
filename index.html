<!-- PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY -->
<section id="summary" class="section-card">
  <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I am a committed Business Management with Innovation and Technology student with a growing passion for digital transformation, user experience improvement and designing smarter business processes. My background combines academic knowledge with real workplace experience, helping me understand how technology supports organisational growth. During my time working at Clarks, I developed confidence, responsibility and strong communication skills through daily interactions with customers and families. I played an active role in supporting young children during shoe fittings, making sure they felt comfortable while also helping parents feel reassured and informed. I worked efficiently under pressure and I was trusted with important responsibilities such as accurate money handling and maintaining organisation on the shop floor.

    These experiences helped me become patient, adaptable and focused on finding solutions. They also shaped my interest in modern digital systems and how they can improve the way businesses operate. I became curious about how technology reduces stress for employees, improves customer journeys and helps organisations stay competitive. This encouraged me to pursue a future career in tech driven project management, where I can combine creativity and analytical thinking to help businesses evolve. I am determined to continue building technical knowledge, strengthening leadership skills and growing into a confident professional who can guide teams and contribute to digital innovation.

<!-- INTERESTS -->
<section id="interests" class="section-card">
  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>
    My interests reflect the experiences that have shaped me over the years, especially my love for travel and exploring different cultures. After spending ten years living in Spain, I became fluent in Spanish and gained a strong appreciation for diversity, communication and adapting to new environments. Travelling to more than twenty countries has helped me grow into a confident and open minded person, and it has taught me the importance of independence and cultural awareness. Every country I visit gives me a new perspective and allows me to connect with people from different backgrounds.

    Another passion of mine is Manchester United. Supporting the club has taught me loyalty, resilience and the importance of teamwork. Football keeps me motivated and gives me a sense of belonging. I also have a growing interest in technology and digital creativity. I enjoy learning about new tools and innovations that help businesses improve their customer experience. In my free time, I explore digital trends, AI developments and modern solutions that can drive change within organisations. These interests keep me inspired and support my personal and professional growth.

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
  <p>
    My future ambition is to become a successful project manager within the technology and innovation sector.
